We have created a web app called Joke Games. It is a website that displays lists of games that you can play and information about them, while always giving you the ability to ask for a joke whilst browsing.

How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Freetogame API, Jokeapi,  MaterializeCSS, JQuery  

The application is built mainly around the Freetogame API. This allows us to display several games and gives us lots of information about the games that we are able to display in our description page. The information taken from the Api allows us to give information of where to play the game, system requirements, and images taken from the game. 

The other feature of the application is the ability to always have the ability to recieve a joke by using the jokeapi simply by hitting a button. Once you hit a joke that information is stored whether or not you liked it in Local Storage and then that information is presented at the bottom of the page in the like dislike columns. 


Lessons Learned:

How to work with multiple APIs and have them run smoothly with one another.
Working as a team to develop things simultaneously in our own branches then merging them with the main. 
Utilizing Slack/Zoom to make wokring on the project at the same time possible.
How to make text print out letter by letter to keep attention of the user.
